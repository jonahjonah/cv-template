\section{Employment}
%Edgar: USE LANGUAGE FROM JOB DESCRIPTIONS!!!!

%M: Okay so I really think you should look at a list of strong verbs for CVs online and pick the ones that you can use for your descriptions--here's a pdf I found http://www.uni.edu/careerservices/students/rcl/docs/actionverbs.pdf that has some great words in categories. 
    %Keep the way you describe each job similar in the tenses and formatting aka if you have a real sentence with a period versus bullet point lines without periods.
    
%R: I don't think you should put as many full sentences or details in this. You can say "Implemented a standalone Rails app for sentiment classifier Idibon Public" – easier to read (then you can include whitespace), includes all the important details. Etc. for all of these.

%M: I think there's too much space in the top half section. It looks really empty and as if you haven't done a lot. Change the spacing in Education and Skills so you can then get to the Employment right away. 
    %There's also too much space between  your contact info and Education. Same with the spacing down at Extracurriculars. 
    %Also in the description for "Cook" the word safety in the second line shouldn't just be alone there. Try to shorten or lengthen description so it doesn't look like that. Anywhere that you only have one word on a line is a waste of space. There's also too much space between the last line of the 1st page and the bottom of the page. Move everything way up. Hope that helps <3

%R: I don't think you need sentences specifying here what exactly you did. You can just say Co-Founder, Swarthmore Cycling Club. Enough said, you know, you can leave that to the readers imagination, or make them ask you. Leave questions to the interviewer. Basically I think you can turn this whole section into a single line, at the bottom of the page.
