    Swarthmore's team of three seniors worked with expert Neil McDevitt, Executive Director of the Deafâ€‘Hearing Communication Centre, to create a web app to spread awareness about accessibility of YouTube videos. Data acquired from the Google Youtube API in real time is displayed as charts using the Chart.js library, showing the percentage of videos that are captioned for those uploaded in a given date range. The user can view data for specific dates and break down the amount captioned within specific categories. We also provide information about why captioning is important beyond accessibility, and a tutorial for how to easily caption YouTube videos. youtube-access.parseapp.com
